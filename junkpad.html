    <h1>Junkpad</h1>
    <p>
      Got your next genius idea? Want to write down that book that got
      recommended to you? Just remembered you have to do laundry today? Write it
      down in Junkpad to remember it for later. Or forget about it. Junkpad
      won’t judge you.

    <h2>Embrace the chaos</h2>
    <p>
      Not everything has to be neatly organised, embrace your chaotic stream of
      consciousness. All notes appear in the same list, sorted by last edited.
      This makes it easy to add notes without any fuss. Just type.
    </p>
    <h2>Put a pin on it</h2>
    <p>
      Some notes are created more equal than others. Pin the most important ones
      to get them in your face, and increase your chances of not forgetting them.
    </p>
    <h2>It’s ok to pick favourites</h2>
    <p>
      There could be treasures even in a dumpster. Mark your favourite notes and
      keep them in a separate list. The VIPs of the junkyard if you will.
